# Challenge Assignment for Module 1

## Description

This project was created to try out different semantic language in an exisiting application, as well as learning to condense CSS commands to streamline and simplify the code, while making sure it still works as intended. Working on this Challenge provided me moments when I clicked into the "Tinkerer Mindset," in which, a problem is not a frustration, but an interesting game to try to win. I ended the assignment invested in cultivating this mindset further, as it will benefit my career journey, and also my blood pressure.

## Usage

This project can be used by other beginning coding students to look over how another beginner interpreted the assignment, and hopefully have a little fun tinkering with it, or adjusting my work to their style.

It will also be used by me in the future to chuckle at my clumsy beginning efforts, while also providing a sense of pride in how far I've come.

## Credits

I collaborated with the instructor of my Bootcamp Cohort, Eliezer Vargas, and the TA, Ian Von Fange, aka Eli and Ian. I also collaborted with the other students in my Cohort, and am grateful to them for their generosity and good humor. Finally, I collaborated extensively with Diet Coke and those Snyder's pretzel sandwiches with the fake cheese, and I want them to know that I love them deeply and will never leave them.
